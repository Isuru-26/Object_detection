# ESP32 Ultrasonic Distance Alert System

A simple IoT prototype built with ESP32, HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, OLED Display (SSD1306), Buzzer, and LED on a dot board (perfboard with soldered connections) to detect objects and provide real-time safety alerts.

# Features
Measures distance using HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor

Displays real-time distance on the OLED screen

Alert mode when distance ≤ 50 cm → buzzer + LED ON for 5s

Safe mode when distance > 50 cm → display shows "Safe"

Fully soldered on dot board for durability and compactness
